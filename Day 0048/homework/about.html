            <p>A car, or an automobile, is a 
                motor vehicle with wheels. 
                Most definitions of cars state 
                that they run primarily on roads, 
                seat one to eight people, have 
                four wheels, and mainly transport 
                people over cargo. There 
                are around one billion cars in use worldwide.

                The French inventor Nicolas-Joseph 
                Cugnot built the first steam-powered 
                road vehicle in 1769, while the Swiss 
                inventor François Isaac de Rivaz designed 
                and constructed the first internal 
                combustion-powered automobile in 1808. 
                The modern car—a practical, marketable 
                automobile for everyday use—was 
                invented in 1886, when the German 
                inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz 
                Patent-Motorwagen. Commercial cars 
                became widely available during the 
                20th century. The 1901 Oldsmobile 
                Curved Dash and the 1908 Ford Model T, 
                both American cars, are widely considered 
                the first mass-produced and 
                mass-affordable cars, respectively. 
                Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, 
                where they replaced horse-drawn carriages. 
                In Europe and other parts of the world, 
                demand for automobiles did not increase 
                until after World War II. In the 21st century, 
                car usage is still increasing rapidly, 
                especially in China, India, and other 
                newly industrialised countries.</p>
