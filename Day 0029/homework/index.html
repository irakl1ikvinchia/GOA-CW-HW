        <h1>history</h1>
        <p>The period of events before the 
            invention of writing systems is 
            considered prehistory.[9] "History" 
            is an umbrella term comprising past 
            events as well as the memory, discovery, 
            collection, organization, presentation, 
            and interpretation of these events. 
            Historians seek knowledge of the past 
            using historical sources such as written 
            documents, oral accounts or traditional 
            oral histories, art and material artifacts, 
            and ecological markers.[10]

            Stories common to a particular culture, 
            but not supported by external sources 
            (such as the tales surrounding King Arthur), 
            are usually classified as cultural heritage 
            or legends.[11][12] History differs from myth 
            in that it is supported by verifiable evidence. 
            However, ancient cultural influences have 
            helped create variant interpretations of the 
            nature of history, which have evolved over 
            the centuries and continue to change today. 
            The modern study of history is wide-ranging, 
            and includes the study of specific regions 
            and certain topical or thematic elements of
            historical investigation. History is taught 
            as a part of primary and secondary education, 
            and the academic study of history is a major 
            discipline in universities.</p>
